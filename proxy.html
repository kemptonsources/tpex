<p>The Baptistry is a place in the temple where members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 12 years or older are baptized for those people who have died.</p>
<p>The Endowment, or blessing, is an ordinance in the temple available for worthy members of the church who are 18 years or older. In this ordinance people make five covenants or promises, they are, the Law of Obedience, the Law of Sacrifice, the Law of the Gospel, the Law of Chastity, and the Law of Consecration. In return for keeping these promises church members get blessings from God. After doing this ordinance for themselves members can then participate in this ordinance for someone who has died.</p>

<p>The Sealing ordinance is the marriage ordinance. In the sealing a man and a woman make covenants or promises between themselves and God. This ordinance allows for the man and woman to be sealed in the life to come. This ordinance can be done for men and women that didn’t have the chance to get sealed before they died.</p>
